    <h4>Just so you understand how to read the chart:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Each day has a vertical black line and a rectangular.</li>
        <li>The vertical black line represents the whole range of values for that day.</li>
        <li>The rectangular represents the open and close values for the day.</li>
        <li>A blue rectangular means the stock went up, and red means it went down.</li>
    </ul>
