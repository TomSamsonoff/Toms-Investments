# Toms-Investments
A website for all your investments research needs.

You can check out real-estate deals and stocks history, as well as exploring the blog.

The website can be found at: https://tomsinvestments.herokuapp.com

Some stuff I use in the code:
* BeautifulSoup - for scraping
* Pandas - for managing data
* sqlite3 - for interacting with database
* aiohttp - for multi-threading
* Bokeh - for displaying a graph
* Folium - for displaying a map
* yfinance - for getting stocks information
* Flask - for building the website
